# Installation
```bash
npm install refresh-me
```
# Motivation
Greenkeeper is not cheap for corporates, I wanted a commandline tool that updates the packages to the latest version.

# Philosophy
The commandline tool does process any arguments works as is. If it detects new version for any of the packages your project uses. 
It will create a branch for each updated dependency, install the newest version of it and merges back the changes to the master if the 
test (`npm test`) runs succesfully. If not, it will keep the head on the branch that's nave will reflect what update went wrong.

# Usage
Depending on your taste you can install this package locally so you will use it form the `node_modules/.bin/refresh-me` or just `refresh-me`. 

# Limitations
Currently supports only npm only, works locally only. Start it form your master branch.
